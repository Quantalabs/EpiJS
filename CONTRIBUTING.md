## New Functions

Place your function in the apropriate file. If you don't know where to put it in, submit an issue! Make sure it is titled properly and works. Then create a pull request and wait for it to be accepted.

## Bugs

If you are changing a bug, create an issue and then (hopefully) fix it in the file. Again, make sure that it works. Use an issue template!

## Efficiency

If you are changing a function to make it more efficient, make sure to again create an issue and fix it. And most importantly, **make sure it works**.
