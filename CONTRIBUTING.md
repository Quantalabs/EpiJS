# Contributing guidelines

## First Steps

Before fixing any issues, first [fork](https://github.com/Quantalabs/EpiJS/fork) the repo, and then clone your fork:
```SH
git clone https://github.com/[USERNAME]/epijs.git
cd epijs
```

Once you've made your desired changes to the source code in EpiJS, run:
```SH
npm run build
```
Which will update the `web` directory with new minified code. You can then commit your changes and submit your PR.
