```javascript
EpiJS module for creating compartments, which can be combined into models.
```
Import it with:
```
       const comp = require('@quantalabs/epijs').comp
```
## Idiom

Class for a custom compartments.

### Parameters

-   `equation` **[String][29]** The equation for the compartment. This defines what to run to get a new value for the next day in the model. Use any variable in the equation (1 char max), but when making this a model, you need to define this in the key.
         If using other compartment classes, they each have their own corresponding variable:
            \- 'S' - Susceptible
            \- 'E' - Exposed
            \- 'I' - Infectious
            \- 'R' - Recovered
            \- 'D' - Dead
            \- 'C' - Critical
            \- 'H' - Hospitalized
            \- 'V' - Vaccinated

### Examples

```javascript
let susceptible = new Idiom("S-(B*S*I)")
```

## Susceptible

Class for Suscepible compartment.

### Parameters

-   `next` **[Array][30]** List of rates of the next compartments This is multiplied by the current susceptible population.
-   `prev` **[Array][30]** List of rates of the previous compartments, which include sub-arrays
          with the compartment id (one letter only), as a string, and the rate for the compartment.
          If reffering to this compartment's population, use "S" as the id. This parameter is useful
          if you want to model a disease with re-susceptibility.

### Examples

```javascript
// Note that you can pass in a number as a rate too, 
     // but we use a string because we want to multiply 
     // by other compartment populations. This applies to the prev parameter too. 
     let S = new Susceptible(["I*0.4/N"], [])
```

## Infected

Class for Infected compartment.

### Parameters

-   `next` **[Array][30]** List of rates of the next compartments This is multiplied by the current infected population.
-   `prev` **[Array][30]** List of rates of the previous compartments, which include sub-arrays
          with the compartment id (one letter only), as a string, and the rate for the compartment.
          If reffering to this compartment's population, use "I" as the id.

### Examples

```javascript
// Note that you can pass in a string as a rate too, 
     // but we use a number in this case because we don't need to multiply 
     // by other compartment populations. We do actually do this for the prev parameter, though.
     let I = new Infected([0.3], [["S", "I*0.4/N"]])
```

## Exposed

Class for Exposed compartment.

### Parameters

-   `next` **[Array][30]** List of rates of the next compartments This is multiplied by the current exposed population.
-   `prev` **[Array][30]** List of rates of the previous compartments, which include sub-arrays
          with the compartment id (one letter only), as a string, and the rate for the compartment.
          If reffering to this compartment's population, use "E" as the id.

### Examples

```javascript
// Note that you can pass in a string as a rate too, 
     // but we use a number in this case because we don't need to multiply 
     // by other compartment populations. We do actually do this for the prev parameter, though.
     let E = new Exposed([1/14], ["S*0.4/N"])
```

## Critical

Class for Critical compartment.

### Parameters

-   `next` **[Array][30]** List of rates of the next compartments This is multiplied by the current critical population.
-   `prev` **[Array][30]** List of rates of the previous compartments, which include sub-arrays
          with the compartment id (one letter only), as a string, and the rate for the compartment.
          If reffering to this compartment's population, use "C" as the id.

### Examples

```javascript
// Note that you can pass in a string as a rate too, 
     // but we use a number in this case because we don't need to multiply 
     // by other compartment populations.
     let C = new Critical([0.14, 0.1], [["H", 0.3]])
```

## Hospitalized

Class for Hospitalized compartment.

### Parameters

-   `next` **[Array][30]** List of rates of the next compartments This is multiplied by the current hospitalized population.
-   `prev` **[Array][30]** List of rates of the previous compartments, which include sub-arrays
          with the compartment id (one letter only), as a string, and the rate for the compartment.
          If reffering to this compartment's population, use "H" as the id.

### Examples

```javascript
// Note that you can pass in a string as a rate too, 
     // but we use a number in this case because we don't need to multiply 
     // by other compartment populations.
     let H = new Hospitalized([0.3], [["I", 0.1], ["E", 0.2]])
```

## Dead

Class for the Dead compartment.

### Parameters

-   `next` **[Array][30]** List of rates of the next compartments. This is multiplied by the current dead population.
          Useful if you want to have a dead population that can also be the walking dead.
-   `prev` **[Array][30]** List of rates of the previous compartments, which include sub-arrays
          with the compartment id (one letter only), as a string, and the rate for the compartment.
          If reffering to this compartment's population, use "D" as the id.

### Examples

```javascript
// Note that you can pass in a string as a rate too, 
     // but we use a number in this case because we don't need to multiply 
     // by other compartment populations. We do actually do this for the prev parameter, though.
     let D = new Dead([0.3], [["I", 0.3]]) // This disease also gives you a 3/10 chance to come alive after death.
```

## Vaccinated

Class for Vaccinated compartment.

### Parameters

-   `next` **[Array][30]** List of rates of the next compartments, good if the vaccine isn't 100% effective. This is multiplied by the current vaccinated population.
-   `prev` **[Array][30]** List of rates of the previous compartments, which include sub-arrays
          with the compartment id (one letter only), as a string, and the rate for the compartment.
          If reffering to this compartment's population, use "V" as the id.

### Examples

```javascript
// Note that you can pass in a string as a rate too, 
     // but we use a number in this case because we don't need to multiply 
     // by other compartment populations. We do actually do this for the prev parameter, though.
     let I = new Infected([0.001], ["S*0.4"])
```

## Recovered

Class for Recovered compartment.

### Parameters

-   `prev` **[Array][30]** List of rates of the previous compartments, which include sub-arrays
          with the compartment id (one letter only), as a string, and the rate for the compartment.
          If reffering to this compartment's population, use "V" as the id.
