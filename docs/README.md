EpiJS is a epidemiological modelling package for JavaScript with built-in support for SIR-based models including SIR, SEIR, SEIRD, and other models, along with allowing you to create custom models, model community spread through SIR based models, and more.
:::

Get started by installing the package:
```sh
npm i @epispot/epijs
yarn add @epispot/epijs
pnpm add @epispot/epijs
```
And add it to your code:
```javascript
const epijs = require('@epispot/epijs')
```
With that we can start by creating a super basic SIR model:
```javascript
const sir = epijs.pre.sir(4, 9999, 1, 1/14, 10000, true)

plot(sir, 100, "SIR", "SIR Model (Population vs. Time)")
```
And:
